    "# Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discuss different approaches you could take to estimate which inventory fits a given client. Explain which data sources you considered and which approaches/algorithms are possible. Bonus points for using descriptive statistics to understand trade-offs between different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high-level this assignment fits a canonical form in data science of designing a recommendation system.  The system is responsible for returning a predicted set of user-specific items of interest.  Classically, there are two ways of inferring user interest in an item: content-based and collaborative-based filtering.  In the first, item-to-item similarity is deduced, and items are suggested to a user based upon what they have evaluated highly in the past.  In the second user-to-user similarity is measured and used to advance item recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the specific problem of taking the data supplied and ultimately producing item recommendations on the basis of fit, the decision of which filtering strategy to pursue turns on a number of questions\n",
    "- What style or sku specific data is available.  For content-based filtering we need an explicit basis of features to paramatize the items, and this basis should be sufficient to explain user-item fit.\n",
    "- How are user-item interactions recorded in the data?  It appears that overall satisfaction is measured via a likert scale of \"loved it\", \"liked it\", \"just okay,\" however, we're exclusively interested in feedback as it pertains to clothing fit.  This is measured with a more complex relationship in the data wherein, under certain situations, fit satisfaction is recorded via a binary feature, and in the event of fit disatisfaction, more specific feedback is collected.  This response behavior needs to be marshalled into a single number indicating implicit fit feedback.  \n",
    "- How large is the dataset?  As mentioned above, collaborative filtering relies upon assessing user-to-user similarity, if the dataset is large then neighborhood methods which compute pairwise user-to-user distances across the full set of items will likely be too costly.\n",
    "- How much feedback is there for all the user-item combinations in the dataset?  The success of many recommendor algorithims depends upon the sparsity of the user-item matrix.\n",
    "- Is the problem of fit primarily one of \"discovery\" i.e. do we want to suggest items outside of a users typical ordering habits?  Or is it one of \"retriaval\" where the goal is to surface styles most similiar to what a user has ordered before?  \n",
    "- Are their \"exogenous\" features that the model should capture?  Generally, content-based filtering allows one to paramatize the items freely, but introducing user-based features is more difficult.  A similiar challenge exists for collobarative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: my general approach is taken from this [2008 survery paper by Koren and Bell.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36167999/Collaborative-Filtering-_Koren-and-Bell_.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1524775559&Signature=%2B03E69kBr%2Fznn1sN4vk%2BoQ1shvI%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAdvances_in_Collaborative_Filtering.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "I choose to treat this as a collaborative filtering problem solved via matrix factorization.  Briefly, this approach assumes that the user-item matrix is a high-dimensional, rank-deficient representation of the data.    That is, there exists a basis in a lower dimensions that well paramatizes the users and items.  If we're succesful in recovering this basis, then we can use it to \"reconstruct\" the missing values in the user-item matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was drawn to this approach for three reasons.\n",
    "- First, I was aware that this method has been popular recently for similiar types of recommendation problems.\n",
    "- Second, the dataset contains 35,000 unique users, 4,000 unique styles, and 24,167 unique skus.  Thus the dimensions of the problem are \"largish\" for a personal computer.  Indeed, I ruled out treating items at the sku level due to the resulting size of the interaction matrix.  Even just considering the problem at the style level, a dense matrix which encodes fit feedback with an integer value (assuming numpy's int64 format of 8 Bytes / interger value) would consume $35,000 \\times 4,000 \\times 8 \\approx 1 GB$ of memory.  Additionally, the measured sparsity for the user item matrix was about .018, which seemed to be comparable to the sparsity for other large scale collaborative filtering problems (https://www.quora.com/How-sparse-is-the-real-life-dataset-for-recommender-systems).  \n",
    "- Third, this approach makes it easy to introduce additional user specific features into the objective function in a theoretically consistent manner.  This has the added benefit of presenting a solution for the so-called \"cold start\" problem.  When there's insufficient item interaction data for a user, the model will make recommendations based upon learned baseline biases for the overall dataset and items, as well as initial user data (nominal size, height, weight, bmi).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem may be mathmatically expressed as follows.  We wish to minimize the the difference between the original user-item matrix, $R$, and a reconstruction of it formed from a low rank factorization, $\\hat{R}$.  The objective function the takes the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n",
    "&\\textrm{min} \\quad &&\\sum_{(u,i) \\in R} \\; (R_{ui} - \\hat{R}_{ui}) \\\\\n",
    "&\\textrm{subject to} \\quad &&\\textrm{Rank}\\left(\\hat{R}\\right)=k\n",
    "\\end{alignat*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the elements of $\\hat{R}$ are expressed as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{r}_{ui} = \\mu + b^i_i + b^u_u + q_i^T \\left(p_u + |N(u)|^{-.5} \\sum_{j \\in N(u)} y_j \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$, and $b_u \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ make up the baseline model for the user-item rating.  The scalar $\\mu$ represents an overall bias for the entire matrix, and corresponds to how well clothing fits users on average.  Similarly, the scalars $b^i_i$ and $b^u_u$ denote the average biases for item $i$ and user $u$.  The interaction of a specific user and item is captured through the inner product of the item's latent feature vector, $q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ and the \"augmented\" latent user vector given by $p_u + |N(u)|^{-.5} \\sum_{j \\in N(u)} y_j$, where $p_u$ is the representation of the user in the latent space learned from their item interactions, and the $y_j$ are the latent factor representations of additional user information (size, height, ... etc).  $N(u)$ justs denotes the cardinality of the set of additional user features and is used to normalize the resultant vector for stability (Koren & Bell).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function can now be written more explicitly as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n",
    "&\\min_{\\mu, b_i, b_u, Q, P, Y} \\quad &&\\sum_{(u,i) \\in R} \\; r_{ui} -\\mu + b^i_i + b^u_u + q_i^T \\left(p_u + |N(u)|^{-.5} \\sum_{j \\in N(u)} y_j \\right) \\\\\n",
    "&\\textrm{subject to} \\quad && Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times k}, \\; P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times n}, Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times N(u_1, ... u_m)}\n",
    "\\end{alignat*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimizers $\\mu^*$, $b^*_i$, $b^*_u$, $Q^*,$ $P^*$, $Y^*$ can be found through different optimization routines.  I choose SGD due to ease-of-implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2\n",
    "##### Choose the approach you think is best suited for an MVP. The goal is to find an algorithm that is relatively easy to implement, and still provides significant value for our customers. Implement the algorithm as a function that returns an orderd list of styles for each user fit_reco(user_id) = [\"CEL13_1\", \"VIN69_XS\", ...] . In that ordered list, the first sku is our best fit recommendation for the client, and skus lower on the list are expected to fit less well.\n",
